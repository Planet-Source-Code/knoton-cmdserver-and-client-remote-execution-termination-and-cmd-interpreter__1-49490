CMDServer is a Server that you can connect with CMDClient to perform Remote Execution,
Remote Termination of processes and most tasks in the Command Interpreter.

CMDServer can only run on NT Systems (NT,Win2K,XP)

Due to the user validation the server does on remote connection attempts, the server must
run on a machine there the loggedin user has adminstrative rights.

Use CMDClient from any computer that can reach CMDServer to perform all
Commands available from the commandprompt and those listed below

CONNECT IP/Host[:Port] (Connect to CMDServer on Port = 512)
EXIT (Close connection)
REXIT (Close down cmdServer)
CMDHELP (Show this help)
GETRUNAPP (Show running apps)
REXEC [FullPath/]Filename.ext [parameters] (Execute remote application)
RTERM HWND (Close running app)
CLS (Clear Screen)

When a user want to make a remote connection to the server the user will be prompt for
Username and password, the user most have administrator rights on the server.

OBSERVER that if you remotly start an application via cmd the server will not return until the application is terminated.
